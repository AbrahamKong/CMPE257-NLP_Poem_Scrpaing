Then we shoulder’d thro’ the swarm,\\nAnd rounded by the stillness of the beach\\nTo where the bay runs up its latest horn.\\n\\n   We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp’d\\nThe flat red granite; so by many a sweep\\nOf meadow smooth from aftermath we reach’d\\nThe griffin-guarded gates, and pass’d thro’ all\\nThe pillar’d dusk of sounding sycamores,\\nAnd cross’d the garden to the gardener’s lodge,\\nWith all its casements bedded, and its walls\\nAnd chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.\\n\\n\\n   There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid\\nA damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,\\nBrought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,\\nAnd, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,\\nWhere quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,\\nLike fossils of the rock, with golden yolks\\nImbedded and injellied; last, with these,\\nA flask of cider from his father’s vats,\\nPrime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat\\nAnd talk’d old matters over; who was dead,\\nWho married, who was like to be, and how\\nThe races went, and who would rent the hall:\\nThen touch’d upon the game, how scarce it was\\nThis season; glancing thence, discuss’d the farm,\\nThe four-field system, and the price of grain;\\nAnd struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,\\nAnd came again together on the king\\nWith heated faces; till he laugh’d aloud;\\nAnd, while the blackbird on the pippin hung\\nTo hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang–\\n\\n\\n   ‘Oh! who would fight and march and countermarch,\\nBe shot for sixpence in a battle-field,\\nAnd shovell’d up into some bloody trench\\nWhere no one knows? but let me live my life.\\n   ‘Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,\\nPerch’d like a crow upon a three-legg’d stool,\\nTill all his juice is dried, and all his joints\\nAre full of chalk? but let me live my life.\\n   ‘Who’d serve the state? for if I carved my name\\nUpon the cliffs that guard my native land,\\nI might as well have traced it in the sands;\\nThe sea wastes all: but let me live my life.\\n   ‘Oh! who would love? I woo’d a woman once,\\nBut she was sharper than an eastern wind,\\nAnd all my heart turn’d from her, as a thorn\\nTurns from the sea; but let me live my life.’\\n\\n\\n   He sang his song, and I replied with mine:\\nI found it in a volume, all of songs,\\nKnock’d down to me, when old Sir Robert’s pride,\\nHis books–the more the pity, so I said–\\nCame to the hammer here in March–and this–\\nI set the words, and added names I knew.\\n\\n\\n   ‘Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep, and dream of me:\\nSleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister’s arm,\\nAnd sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.\\n   ‘Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia’s arm;\\nEmilia, fairer than all else but thou,\\nFor thou art fairer than all else that is.\\n   ‘Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:\\nSleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:\\nI go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.\\n   ‘I go, but I return: I would I were\\nThe pilot of the darkness and the dream.\\nSleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me.’\\n\\n\\n   So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,\\nThe farmer’s son, who lived across the bay,\\nMy friend; and I, that having wherewithal,\\nAnd in the fallow leisure of my life\\nA rolling stone of here and everywhere,\\nDid what I would; but ere the night we rose\\nAnd saunter’d home beneath a moon, that, just\\nIn crescent, dimly rain’d about the leaf\\nTwilights of airy silver, till we reach’d\\nThe limit of the hills; and as we sank\\nFrom rock to rock upon the glooming quay,\\nThe town was hush’d beneath us: lower down\\nThe bay was oily calm; the harbour-buoy,\\nSole star of phosphorescence in the calm,\\nWith one green sparkle ever and anon\\nDipt by itself, and we were glad at heart. © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes     '],\n",

My chief purpose in including these verses here is that students may note the variety of the pieces of this class addressed to different correspondents. Compare this with the Devon pieces sent to Haydon, and more particularly with The Gadfly, sent to Tom Keats a little later than this. I presume this piece should be dated the 3rd of July 1818.\\n\\n(stanza 2): This is a genuine autobiographic reminiscence of the time when the young Keatses lived with their grandmother after the death of their parents.\\n\\n(stanza 4): There is an under-current of dissatisfaction with things Caledonian in this fourth stanza; and indeed I do not think Keats ever got entirely rid of this during the whole of the tour, albeit he enjoyed many transient visitations of true enthusiasm inspired both by fine scenery and by associations.\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

The words \"Foot of Helvellyn, June 27th,\" are printed in The World as if they belonged to the next piece copied into the journal-letter; but the context indicates that the date really belongs to the acrostic. Keats (with his friend Charles Armitage Brown) was on the way to Carlisle, to take coach there for Dumfries and begin the walking tour in Scotland on which the first serious break-down of his health occurred. Leaving London about the middle of June, they had seen the George Keatses off from Liverpool for America, and had then started walking from Lancaster; so that, by the time Keats was writing the Acrostic, he had already been walking several days; and four days later the friends reached Carlisle, ending there the English portion of their walk.\\'~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

My chief purpose in including these verses here is that students may note the variety of the pieces of this class addressed to different correspondents. Compare this with the Devon pieces sent to Haydon, and more particularly with The Gadfly, sent to Tom Keats a little later than this. I presume this piece should be dated the 3rd of July 1818.\\n\\n(stanza 2): This is a genuine autobiographic reminiscence of the time when the young Keatses lived with their grandmother after the death of their parents.\\n\\n(stanza 4): There is an under-current of dissatisfaction with things Caledonian in this fourth stanza; and indeed I do not think Keats ever got entirely rid of this during the whole of the tour, albeit he enjoyed many transient visitations of true enthusiasm inspired both by fine scenery and by associations.\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

The words \"Foot of Helvellyn, June 27th,\" are printed in The World as if they belonged to the next piece copied into the journal-letter; but the context indicates that the date really belongs to the acrostic. Keats (with his friend Charles Armitage Brown) was on the way to Carlisle, to take coach there for Dumfries and begin the walking tour in Scotland on which the first serious break-down of his health occurred. Leaving London about the middle of June, they had seen the George Keatses off from Liverpool for America, and had then started walking from Lancaster; so that, by the time Keats was writing the Acrostic, he had already been walking several days; and four days later the friends reached Carlisle, ending there the English portion of their walk.\\'~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.
